```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#Load the data

First,we are going to use read.csv to load the gapminder data.

```{r}
dat <-  read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")
summary(dat)
```

# Plot the data

## Setup

We need to load ggplot2 package:
```{r}
library(ggplot2, echo)
```

## Plotting

```{r}
ggplot(data = dat,
       mapping = aes(x = year,
                     y = lifeExp,
                     by = country,
                     color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Insert pre-made figure

We have a figure at "figures/life_exp.png". We must insert that in our report.

```{r, fig.cap = "Life Expectancy vs. Year, for each country, facetted by by continent"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/life_exp.png")
```
